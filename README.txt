There is a little bug where, when searching for an item, the user must wait some seconds then press spacebar or any other character on the search field so the elements load in the page.
This project was made using React and the NewsApi module.
The search bar desing was inspired by "https://github.com/simonjsuh/Wikipedia-Search-API-using-React.js.git".
Prior to this project, I had no knowledge of JSX, CSS , HTML nor JavaScript.
It was a great learning experience where I applied more hours than the recommended 15.
